# CODECRAFT_DS_04
This repository contains my submission for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship at CodeCraft Infotech. The objective of this task was to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands.

# ğŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Twitter_Entity _Sentiment _Analysis_Dataset([twitter_training.csv]) from Kaggle. It includes labeled Twitter posts with sentiment annotations related to various entities (e.g., organizations, celebrities, etc.).

# ğŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
ğŸ”¹ Jupyter Notebook

ğŸ”¹ Pandas

ğŸ”¹ NumPy

ğŸ”¹ Matplotlib & Seaborn

ğŸ”¹ Scikit-learn

ğŸ”¹ NLTK / SpaCy

ğŸ”¹ WordCloud

ğŸ”¹ Seaborn & Plotly for interactive visualizations


# ğŸ“ˆ Key Highlights
ğŸ”¹ Cleaned and preprocessed raw Twitter text effectively

ğŸ”¹ Performed in-depth analysis to reveal sentiment polarity trends

ğŸ”¹ Visualized entity-level sentiment shifts using bar plots and pie charts

ğŸ”¹ Trained and tested baseline classification models

ğŸ”¹ Highlighted frequent keywords and hashtags using WordClouds

ğŸ”¹ Achieved meaningful classification results that reflect public sentiment on various topics

# ğŸ§¾ Conclusion
This task demonstrated how social media sentiment analysis can provide actionable insights into public opinion and brand perception. Text preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning modeling were crucial to understanding and interpreting social sentiment effectively.
